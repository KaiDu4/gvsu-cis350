# Clueless Team

The project idea that we have come up with is an application that will allow teachers to share their lesson plans. We will ask the user to select what state they are in, and also what grade(s) they teach to be able to give them resources more specific to them easier, but will still make the entire collection available to them. We will hopefully have a few templates already but will have teachers create more and the collection will grow as the user interaction grows.
