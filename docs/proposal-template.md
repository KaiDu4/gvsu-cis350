# Introduction
The project idea that we have come up with is an application that will allow teachers to share their lesson plans. (Gonna add more still here)
(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

# Anticipated Technologies
We will need our laptops, possibly go and use a PC to be able to handle all of the application if one of our laptops doesn't have enough processing power. We will install a Java IDE, as of right now it will be IntelliJ IDEA.
(What technologies are needed to build this project)

# Method/Approach
We are planning on splitting the work on some working on the backend side of the project and the others working on the front end and then we will come together to get themm to all work together. We have a plan for how the app is going to look and work, which is what will allow us to split the work this way, also this way when we bring both ends together it will just be editing some code instead of having to start all new code.
(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

# Estimated Timeline
We'll start by focusing on the back end so we can support the front end before we start fully working on the front end. I estimate this will take about a week. From there the front end will start to be able to get programmed which, we will want to have the general outline even if it doesn't do anything or fully work after about a week. I feel that each step that we want to complete can be broken up into week long things and it will make the work easier to manage than setting big things to hit after 4 weeks. I guess having the full back end "done" minus finding bugs could take about a month to a month and a half. Then getting the front end to look how we want can take about 2 months and will line up with finishing the back end.
(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems
We are planningon using Java for most of our coding for the app, the problems we may have with this is that none of us have a whole lot of expeerience with programming in Java so we will be struggling a bit with that but besides that it does not seem as though we should run into too many issues.
(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
